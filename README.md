# IB MYP 26
This is my 10th grade IB MYP (International Baccalaureate Middle Years Program) project, done in the 2025-2026 school year.

My aim was to learn JavaScript, and this is where my final product (a website containing several games coded in JavaScript) will be located.

More notes about the project:

This is my first JavaScript project, and chances are my code will be sloppy, probably with some flaws. If you can, please report an here on github.

I eventually want to host this project on the web but as my project is still a work-in-progress and hosting is low on my to-do list, it's going to take me awhile.
