    <p>This is my 10th grade IB MYP (International Baccalaureate Middle Years Program) project, done in the 2025-2026 school year.</p>

    <p>My aim was to learn JavaScript, and this is where my final product (a website containing several games coded in JavaScript) will be located.</p>

    <p>This is my first JavaScript project, and chances are my code will be sloppy, probably with some flaws. If you can, please report an here on github.</p>
